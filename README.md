# Samantha Roberts PhD

I’m an AI developer and applied systems builder with a foundation in solid-state physics and nanoscience.

I build agentic AI platforms for complex technical organizations, with an emphasis on retrieval-augmented and tool-using systems rather than standalone models. My work focuses on architectures that combine multiple forms of retrieval (vector, structured, hybrid), augmented generation, MCP-style service boundaries, and automation pipelines that can be deployed, evaluated, and **operated with clear grounding, traceability, and constraints**.

Core technical areas include document ingestion and normalization, chunking and metadata strategy, hybrid retrieval, evaluation harnesses for retrieval and generation quality, and agent workflows that integrate external tools and databases. I am especially interested in systems where correctness, traceability, and operational fit are critical.

I care about building things that matter. I strongly prefer open-source solutions when they are the right tool, and I believe shared infrastructure and community-driven code are essential for scaling technical knowledge beyond individual organizations.


For concrete examples, see the pinned repositories and my portfolio.

## What I build
- 
- **RAG + knowledge systems** (document pipelines, chunking/metadata strategy, evals, retrieval UX)
- **Hybrid retrieval** (vector + structured DB queries + citations)
- **Applied automation** (ops dashboards, billing/usage analytics, workflow tooling)
- **Interfaces people actually use** (Streamlit/FastAPI prototypes → maintainable services)

## Featured projects
- **Nanobot-CORE** — document ingestion + pgvector RAG foundation (Docling → chunking → embeddings → retrieval)  
  Repo: https://github.com/srobertsphd/nanobot-core

- **RAG-bot** — customizable RAG chatbot for PDF manuals (Streamlit + vector DB)  
  Repo: https://github.com/srobertsphd/RAG-bot

- **Portfolio** (write-ups, outcomes, demos)

## What I’m exploring next
- Evaluation harnesses for retrieval quality (ground-truth sets, failure mode taxonomy)
- “Knowledge graph + RAG” patterns for equipment / process relationships
- Productionizing doc pipelines: versioning, monitoring, and human feedback loops
