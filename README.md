## Samantha Roberts PhD

I’m an AI developer and applied systems builder with a foundation in solid-state physics and nanoscience.

I build agentic AI platforms for complex technical organizations, focusing on architectures and automation pipelines that can be evaluated, deployed and operated with clear grounding, traceability, and constraints.

I care about building things that matter. I strongly prefer open-source solutions when they are the right tool, and I believe shared infrastructure and community-driven code are essential for scaling technical knowledge beyond individual organizations.

### What I build

- **Agentic AI workflows** — multi-step, tool-using systems that coordinate retrieval, reasoning, automation, and external services to solve real operational problems.
- **Knowledge and retrieval infrastructure** — document ingestion pipelines, chunking and metadata strategy, hybrid retrieval across unstructured and structured sources, and evaluation for retrieval and generation quality.
- **Data and knowledge aggregation** — analytics pipelines, structured data models, and dashboards that surface operational insight and connect system behavior back to measurable outcomes.
- **End-to-end AI applications** — systems built from ingestion and orchestration through deployment, monitoring, and iteration, with architectures designed for maintainability and real operational constraints.
