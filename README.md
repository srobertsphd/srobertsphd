## Samantha Roberts PhD

I’m an AI developer and applied systems builder with a foundation in solid-state physics and nanoscience.

I build agentic AI platforms for complex technical organizations, with an emphasis on retrieval-augmented and tool-using systems focusing on architectures that combine multiple forms of retrieval (vector, structured, hybrid), augmented generation, MCP-style services, and automation pipelines that can be evaluated, and operated and deployed with clear grounding, traceability, and constraints.

I care about building things that matter. I strongly prefer open-source solutions when they are the right tool, and I believe shared infrastructure and community-driven code are essential for scaling technical knowledge beyond individual organizations.

#### What I build

- **Agentic AI workflows** -- multi-step, tool-using systems that coordinate retrieval, reasoning, automation, and external services to solve real operational problems.
- **Knowledge and retrieval infrastructure** -- document ingestion pipelines, chunking and metadata strategy, hybrid retrieval across unstructured and structured sources, and evaluation for retrieval and generation quality.
- **Data and knowledge aggregation** — analytics pipelines, structured data models, and dashboards that surface operational insight and connect system behavior back to measurable outcomes.
- **End-to-end AI applications** -- from data ingestion and orchestration through deployment, monitoring, and iteration, with architectures designed for maintainability and real operational constraints.

#### Featured projects
- **Nanobot-CORE** — document ingestion + pgvector RAG foundation (Docling → chunking → embeddings → retrieval)  
  Repo: https://github.com/srobertsphd/nanobot-core  
  Website context:https://www.samantharoberts.com/portfolio/labnetwork-nanobot

- **RAG-bot** — customizable RAG chatbot for PDF manuals (Streamlit + vector DB)  
  Repo: https://github.com/srobertsphd/RAG-bot

#### What I’m exploring next
- Evaluation harnesses for retrieval quality (ground-truth sets, failure mode taxonomy)
- “Knowledge graph + RAG” patterns for equipment / process relationships
- Productionizing doc pipelines: versioning, monitoring, and human feedback loops
